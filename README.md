## Output?
When it looks up all materials and make a html for chart, it will save .html in directory you run .exe file and open it in your default web browser.<br/>
Nodes will have <ins>count of total</ins> coponents needed for finished final product.<br/>
You can also play with options:
* Don't open file in web browsen whn it is created
* Don't save file after viewing it
* Change nodo colour
* Dont add title on top

By the way... all component nodes in chart have wiki links, so you can click on them!<br/>

## Future update ideas:
* Standalone .exe file ✅
* Count materials and display numbers next to chart elements✅
* Less manual work gatherig data...

<br/><br/>
.exe file was simply created from .py file by using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/"> auto-py-to-exe</a> so there is possibility thet some antivirus software flags it as false positive :/<br/>
